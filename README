Welcome to Chart Your Times!

Author: David Chao

Notes: The site begins at index.php

v2.1 index.php does not have any content. Most changes were made to setup.

v3.1 

-authentication not implemented yet. User is set as testUser.
-create half working. no individual records for activities yet.
-read half working. no details API page yet.
-update not yet implemented.
-delete not yet implemented.
-styling not yet implemented. backup folder is jQuery mobile. Currently bootstrap is set up. Still experimenting.

--Create
- No standardization for inputs yet.

--Assets
- only sql dump has been updated.

Could use some help with:
-signaling content
-report misuse
-feed subscription
any suggestions are appreciated.
